# SentinelAI: AI-Powered Fraud Detection & Mitigation System

SentinelAI is a high-fidelity cybersecurity platform mockup designed to identify and mitigate various forms of fraud generated by Generative AI (GenAI). This project was developed as a comprehensive solution to modern digital threats like AI-written phishing, deepfake voice scams, and credential exposure.

## 🛡️ Core Modules

### 1. Command Center (Dashboard)
- **Live Threat Feed**: Real-time monitoring of intercepted attacks.
- **Analytics**: Visual breakdown of attack vectors (Phishing, Deepfakes, Malicious URLs).
- **System Metrics**: Monitoring of detection engine health and confidence scores.

### 2. Email Analysis Engine
- **Phishing Detection**: Identifies AI-generated phishing emails using fine-tuned LLM patterns.
- **Urgency Analysis**: Scans for social engineering tactics and high-pressure language.
- **Credential Leak Scoping**: Automatically identifies if sensitive data is being requested.

### 3. Web Scanner & Anti-Pharming
- **URL Verification**: Detects homograph spoofing and malicious domain signatures.
- **Certificate Audit**: Verifies SSL integrity to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Pharming Mitigation**: Identifies malicious website clones designed to steal cookies or credentials.

### 4. Media Forensics (Deepfake Detection)
- **Audio Analysis**: Identifies synthetic voice patterns generated by models like ElevenLabs or VALL-E.
- **Artifact Identification**: Scans for spectral anomalies consistent with AI text-to-speech.

### 5. Credential Guard
- **Breach Monitoring**: Checks identifiers against known dark-web data dumps.
- **Risk Tiering**: Provides a risk score based on the severity and freshness of data exposure.

## 🛠️ Technology Concept
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS v4, Framer Motion (for interactive scanning animations).
- **Architecture**: Design-led mockup focused on human-readable explanations and high-trust UI.
- **Design Philosophy**: Cyber-Security Command Center aesthetic with a focus on data density and clear actionable alerts.
